<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
   My journey into software development began with the exciting possibilities that the field 
   <br/>
   offers—a world where creativity meets logic, and the challenge to innovate is ever-present. 
   <br/>
   Currently, I’m diving deep into “The Complete 2024 Web Developer Bootcamp,” working on 
   <br/>
   HTML projects that have equipped me with foundational skills in HTML and Visual Studio 
   <br/>
   Code. Although I’m new to this path, my enthusiasm for learning and growing in all areas of 
   <br/>
   development drives me forward.

</p>

<p>
   coding, I bring a wealth of experience in leadership and adaptability from my role as 
   <br/>
   a Sergeant in the National Guard, where I lead a team of six and have taken on diverse 
   <br/>
   responsibilities. My time in the military has honed my resilience, problem-solving skills, and
   <br/>
   dedication—qualities I am eager to apply in the tech industry.
</p>

<p>
   My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute my skills to a company that 
   <br/>
   values hard work, stability, and flexibility. Originally from Colombia, I moved to the U.S. 
   <br/>
   alone at 12 and joined the Army at 19, which has instilled in me an unwavering commitment 
   <br/>
   and drive to succeed. In every role, I bring grit, flexibility, and the capacity to work through 
   <br/>
   challenges with a creative mindset.
</p>
<p>
   I hope that through this portfolio, you’ll see my dedication to continuous learning and my 
   <br/>
   passion for contributing to a team that values growth and integrity. Let’s connect and explore 
   <br/>
   the future together!
